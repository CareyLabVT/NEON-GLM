Water level, volume, area, and stage curve relationships provide spatial quantitative information. They also impart a governing role on hydrodynamics, chemical reactions and biotic distribution and productivity. Furthermore, temporal comparisons between bathymetries can be used as an indicator of environmental change by providing information on ecosystem functioning, changes in water turnover times and storage, and catchment erosion-sedimentation rates (Dost and Mannaerts, 2008). Obtaining baseline characteristics, hence, becomes imperative in light of future activities aimed at a better understanding of lake and river dynamics as well as health through time.

Access to NEON field sites is governed by site host policies and permitting requirements. The properties on which NEON infrastructure and observational plots are located are owned by site hosts. Our rights of access and use are defined in formal Land Use Agreements with these landowners and site hosts. Researchers must obtain their own site host permits for their research. Our science and domain field staff can assist in a variety of ways:
Science staff may assist in evaluating the potential impacts of proposed activities on NEON measurements and observations
Domain Managers may assist with site host coordination and location of field sampling on site.
Other assistance may be requested and offered as appropriate.

If you are interested in conducting investigations near NEON infrastructure and/or observational plots, please contact us to discuss your ideas.
